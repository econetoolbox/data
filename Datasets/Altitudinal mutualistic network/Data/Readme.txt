Albrecht, J., Classen, A., Vollst√§dt, M. G., Mayr, A., Mollel, N. P., Schellenberger Costa, D., ... & Schleuning, M. (2018). Plant and animal functional diversity drive mutualistic network assembly across an elevational gradient. Nature Communications, 9(1), 3177.
Data downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6633032

Network information:
"01BirdFruitInteractions.csv" = bird-fruit interactions sampled in the different study sites. 
"02BirdFlowerInteractions.csv" = bird-flower interactions sampled in the different study sites. 
"03InsectFlowerInteractions.csv" = insect-flower interactions sampled in the different study sites. 
The data is reported as a list of interactions, with "plot" corresponding to the study site, and "frequency" the number of times an interactions has been observed.

Study site information:
"00PlotData.csv" = table giving for each study site the land use ("habitat_description"), the level of anthropogenic disturbance ("lu" = "disturbed" vs. "undisturbed"), the altitude ("elev"), mean annual precipitation ("map") and mean annual temperature ("mat").

Traits of species:
"01BirdFruitAnimalTraits.csv" = traits of observed frugivorous birds.
"01BirdFruitPlantTraits.csv" = traits of plants consumed by frugivorous birds (fruit properties).
"02BirdFlowerAnimalTraits.csv" = traits of observed flower visitor birds.
"02BirdFlowerPlantTraits.csv" = traits of flowering plants visited by birds.
"03InsectFlowerAnimalTraits.csv" = traits of observed flower visitor insects.
"03InsectFlowerPlantTraits.csv" = traits of flowering plants visited by insects.
