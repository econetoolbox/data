Network and species trait information:
"intertidal_rock_pools.txt" = list of trophic interactions in the different study sites with name and traits of the consumers noted by "con." in the columns, and name and traits of the prey noted by "res." in the columns. Study sites are characterised by their names ("foodweb.name"), geographical location (country or region = "geographic.location", latitude and longitude)
